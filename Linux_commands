File Permissions:

User
Group
others

Read - 4 Write - 2 Execute - 1

to diplay the file permissions we use "ls -ll" command

to give permission to the file we use "chmod" command.

ex: chmod 777 file1   it means for the user group we have given Read,write and execute access. and for group we have given all the three permissions and also to others we have given all the three permissions.

ex 2: chmod 721 file2 it means for users -(Read,write,execute) and group - write permission and for others - only execute permission.
